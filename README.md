Concept Map & Mind Map for Software Project Management

Overview
Presenting a concept and mind map for Oliver’s App – A software application development project which aims to build and deploy an entertainment app which centers around fun, wholesome conversations using creative means.
The journey beings with the company inception and progresses through till the closing phase of the project. The concept map and the mind map being presented hold the central idea of the challenges of project scheduling & resource allocation throughout the application development process. The key concepts of both maps are: Resource requirements; Available resources; Funding Sources; and Business Income.

Concept Map
The concept map addresses the project’s resources. It breaks down into 2 categories; Resources Required and Resources Available. It is made easier to visualize by the variety of shapes used which represent the different parent-child relationships between each node. It also has a color coding system for the different hierarchical classes of nodes. This doesn’t present things in a question-answer format as well as the mind map but does a great job of breaking down each decision that needs to be made. This map would be ideal for the business developer and other stakeholders; getting answers to some of the topics in the nodes would help set realistic project expectations. 

Mind Map
The mind map does a great job of visually answering questions related to the project’s resource allocation. It could do a better job of visually explaining the stakeholders involved in each node as well as visually explaining how and when each node/task will be expected to be done and in what order. The mind map presented has some questions which go unanswered; answering these questions is vital to the success of the project as many of the questions relate to the total resources available at any given time. The mind map does a great job of laying out actionable items. In the right team meeting the mind map could be broken down into assignable tasks by the team.
